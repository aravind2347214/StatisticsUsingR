# Task1

    1.Create two matrices, matrix_A and matrix_B


    2.Calculate the sum of matrix_A and matrix_B and
    store the result in a new matrix named matrix_sum.


    3.Calculate the difference between matrix_A and matrix_B and
    store the result in a new matrix named matrix_diff.


    4.Multiply matrix_A by a scalar value of 2 and store the
    result in a new matrix named matrix_mult.


    5.Calculate the product of matrix_A and matrix_B and
    store the result in a new matrix named matrix_product.


    6.Find the transpose of matrix_A and
    store the result in a new matrix named matrix_A_transpose.


    7.Calculate the determinant of matrix_B and
    store it in a variable named determinant_B.


    8.Invert matrix_B to obtain the inverse matrix and store
    it in a new matrix named matrix_B_inverse.


    9.Check if matrix_B is orthogonal (i.e., its transpose is
    equal to its inverse).


    10.Calculate the element-wise square root of
    matrix_A and
    store the result in a new matrix named matrix_A_sqrt.
    11.Calculate the mean of all the elements in
    matrix_B.


    12.Calculate the sum of each column in matrix_A.


    13.Calculate the row means of matrix_B.


    14.Extract the second row of matrix_A and
    store it in a vector named second_row_A.


    15.Extract the third column of matrix_B and
    store it in a vector named third_column_B.
