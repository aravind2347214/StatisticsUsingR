# Task 1

### You are provided with a vector of monthly sales data for a small business.
### Your task is to perform various operations on this data using vector arithmetic,sorting, and reverse sorting in R.


    1.Create a vector named sales_data with
    the following sales figures (in thousands of dollars) for the last 12 months:
    [45, 60, 35, 75, 80, 62, 48, 53, 69, 72, 40, 55].


    2.Calculate the total annual sales by
    summing the elements in the sales_data vector.


    3.Compute the monthly average sales by
    dividing the total annual sales by 12 (the number of months).


    4.Determine the month with the highest
    sales and the corresponding sales figure. Also, find the month with the lowest
    sales and its sales figure.


    5.Increase the sales figure for the third
    month (March) by 10%.


    6.Sort the sales_data vector in ascending order and create a
    new vector named sorted_sales.


    7.Sort the sales_data vector in descending order and create a
    new vector named reverse_sorted_sales.


    8.Calculate the median sales value from the
    sorted_sales
    vector.
